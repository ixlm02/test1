 <h2>A poem of us</h2>
 <div id="main2">
    <p>
        
        In the moonlight glow, our love takes flight,<br>
A melody sweet, every day and night.<br><br>

Her laughter, a melody, a lyrical song,<br>

In her gaze, a dance, where I belong.<br><br>



Her touch, a verse, on my heart inscribed,<br>

In passion's embrace, our spirits described.<br><br>

Through the echoes of time, our story unfolds,<br>

A melody of love, in verses untold.<br><br>



Her eyes, twin stars, in the celestial dome,<br>

Guiding my heart, where it may roam.<br><br>

With every heartbeat, a poetic refrain,<br>

Our love, an eternal rhyming terrain.<br><br>
